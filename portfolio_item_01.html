            <p>As a first serious foray into attempting to render 3D objects in a 2D space, this work-in-progress project was a great point from which
                I could explore how to effectively bring higher-level mathematics together with programming for my intended end result.
            </p>
            <img src="img/p1_details.png" alt="Code Snippet which runs on user update for rendering and clearing the screenspace">
            <p>This involves a solid chunk of mathematical knowledge regarding vectors and matrices, as well as knowledge of Projecting and Normalizing the rendered result. 
                So far, this project contains code that successfully takes a .OBJ file and displays the end result in a CMD window with a light source. I plan to add camera
                movement support for the future, as well as exploring more realistic light solutions and shading. The end result seen here would not have been possible without
            using OneLineCoder's Console Engine for console window creation and polygon generation.</p>
            <p>Some of the problems I had to overcome with this project involved creating shading on my shapes in a manner which looked convincing enough with a limited color space
                provided by the Windows command-line interface, properly transforming my matrices, and how to ensure triangles were rendered in a method which did not cause
                overlapping or artifacting on display. I ultimately chose for the project to be coded in such a way that any user who looks at the source code could understand
                how the 3D image is being simulated on screen - while this does lead to performance losses, the end result of this is code that is simple to understannd, as well as modify for the future.
            </p>
            <p>The source code for this project is available for viewing on my BitBucket directory.</p>
