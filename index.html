                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>Over the past few years, I've continued to build up my programming skills in Python and begun working with C++ as well as Java. I have a strong interest
                        in data structures, having created a weighted graph with a graphical interface as a capstone project for my Algorithms class. I've done work with Python's
                        various libraries to succesfully analyze data sets and draw conclusions for potential clients, and even made a 3D rendering engine from scratch which can read .OBJ files.

                    <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
                    <p>I find myself coming back to creative writing in my freetime quite often. It's a wonderful outlet for stress and worry, where you can escape into your own
                        hand-crafted universe where the only limit are the depths of your imagination. I've been involved in collaborative writing projects, my own short stories,
                        poetry, and even writing the script for a retro-styled RPG which has seen success!

                    <h3>IT Specialist</h3>
                    <p>I've always had a thing for helping others out with computer problems, essentially having been my household's go-to person for all computer-related issues.
                        Naturally, this time spent working and diagnosing hardware or software lead me to have a strong skillset for all things IT. I've had experience with a 
                        tax reductant agency answering user inquiries regarding various issues to resolve problems, setting up software or hardware for employee use, performing fixes
                        on hardware, and upgrading office network infrastructure for better throughput and management. By all means, never use a hammer!

            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Student & Programmer based out of Chicago</p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I'm a student who's currently studying abroad at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn! Originally from Chicago, Illinois, I find that I've
                    always been drawn to technology - I remember building my own computer when I was still in elementary school and designing websites with fellow colleagues
                    for clients in highschool, while working at a tax reduction company's IT position. My natural affinity for technology and programming lead me to be an assistant 
                    teacher for my computer science class in highschool and gain a strong interest in Python, C++, and Java, from which point I interned with KPMG.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not actively building and improving my programming toolset, I love to produce videos for my personal YouTube channel, write short stories, and am
                    actively invested in social causes I find important. I had the pleasure of being a Black Lives Matter organizer in Warsaw for a period of time during 2020
                    and assisted in Casey Smagala's 2019 39th Ward campaign. I always try to give back to my community any way I can and hope that one day I can do just that
                    for the city which helped shape me into who I am today.
